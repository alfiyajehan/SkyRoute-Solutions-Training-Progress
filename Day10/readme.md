### ðŸŽ¯ Target 5: Intermediate React and Routing

#### Mission 15: Advanced Hooks and Forms

#### Task 1: Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components
- **Duration:** 30 minutes
- **Topics Covered:**
  - **Controlled Components:**
    - Form data controlled by React state
    - Uses `useState` hook
    - Changes handled through `onChange` events
    - React as "single source of truth"
    - **Advantages:**
      - Predictable data flow
      - Immediate access to input value
      - Easy form validation
      - Better control over user input

  - **Uncontrolled Components:**
    - Form data handled by DOM
    - Uses `useRef` hook
    - Values retrieved directly from DOM
    - DOM as "source of truth"
    - **Advantages:**
      - Simpler implementation
      - Good for basic forms
      - Better with third-party DOM libraries
      - Less code for simple scenarios

#### Task 2: Building Forms in React
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Topics Covered:**
  - **Basic Form Handling:**
    - Form elements: `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`
    - Event handling
    - Form submission
  
  - **Capturing Input Data:**
    - Using State (Controlled Components)
    - Form Submission handling
    - Preventing default behavior
  
  - **Best Practices:**
    - Form Validation
