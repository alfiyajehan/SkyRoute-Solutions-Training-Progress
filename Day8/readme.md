### 🚀 Target 3: Local Storage Basics and React.js Frontend Development

#### Misiion 10: Local Storage Basics
- **Duration:** 20 minutes
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Local Storage:
    - A web storage object that is not sent to the server with each request.
    - Used to store data for a particular domain in the browser.
    - Data persists across page refreshes and browser restarts.
  - **Methods:**
    1. `setItem(key, value)`: Sets a key-value pair.
    2. `getItem(key)`: Retrieves the value by key.
    3. `removeItem(key)`: Removes the key and its value.
    4. `clear()`: Deletes everything in local storage.
    5. `key(index)`: Retrieves the key at a given position.
    6. `length`: Returns the number of items stored.
  - **Important Points:**
    - Keys and values must be strings.
    - Use `JSON.stringify(object)` to store objects as strings.
    - Use `JSON.parse(string)` to convert strings back to objects.

### 🚀 Traget 4: React.js Frontend Development

#### Mission 11: Introduction to React and JSX
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Topics Covered:**
  - **What is React?**
    - A JavaScript library used to create user interfaces.
    - Component-based architecture.
    - Declarative approach: Focuses on describing the end state.
    - Used to build Single Page Applications (SPAs).
  - **Introduction to JSX:**
    - JavaScript XML (HTML code inside JavaScript).
    - JSX is converted to JavaScript code using tools like `es-build`.
  - **React Folder Structure:**
    - Organized into folders like `components`, `pages`, `assets`, and `styles`.
  - **Virtual DOM:**
    - A lightweight copy of the real DOM in memory.
    - Tracks changes and updates the real DOM efficiently.

#### Mission 12: Components, Props, and State
- **Duration:** 2 hours
- **Topics Covered:**
  - **Components:**
    - Reusable pieces of code that decrease redundancy and improve maintainability.
    - Types:
      - Functional Components.
      - Class Components.
  - **Props:**
    - Used to pass data, components, or functions to child components.
    - Enables code reusability.
  - **State:**
    - A React hook (`useState`) used to manage dynamic data in components.
    - Updating state triggers a re-render of the component.
  - **Component Lifecycle:**
    - Mount: Component is rendered on the DOM.
    - Update: Component is updated.
    - Unmount: Component is removed from the DOM.

#### Mission 13: Handling Events and Lists
- **Duration:** 1.5 hours
- **Topics Covered:**
  - **Event Handling:**
    - Events like `onClick`, `onChange`, and `onSubmit` are handled using props.
    - Example: `<button onClick={clickHandler}>Click Me</button>`.
  - **State Management:**
    - `useState` hook is used to manage state and trigger UI updates.
  - **Lifting State Up:**
    - Sharing state between components by moving it to their common parent.
