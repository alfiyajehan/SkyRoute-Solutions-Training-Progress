### ðŸš€ Mission 13: Handling events and lists
- **Duration:** 30 minutes
- **Topics Covered:**
  - **Keys in React:**
    - Special string attributes used to identify elements in a list.
    - Improve performance by enabling efficient re-rendering.
    - Prevent unnecessary re-renders of unchanged components.
  - **Conditional Rendering:**
    - **Ternary Operator (`? :`)**: Render one of two elements based on a condition.
    - **Logical AND Operator (`&&`)**: Render a component only if a condition is true.
    - **Multiple Conditions:** Chain multiple conditions using `&&` or nested ternary operators.

#### Mission 14: Introduction to hooks ->
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Topics Covered:**
  - **What are Hooks?**
    - Special functions in React to use state and other React features in functional components.
  - **Why Use Hooks?**
    - Cleaner and reusable code.
    - Avoid switching between class and function components.
    - Share logic across components using custom hooks.
  - **useEffect Hook:**
    - Manage side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.
    - Scenarios:
      1. For every render.
      2. For the first render only.
      3. For the first render and when dependencies change.
      4. To handle unmounting of components.
  - **useState Hook:**
    - Manage state in functional components.
    - Update state to reflect changes in the UI.
