### ðŸš€ Mission 7: CSS Transitions, Transforms, and Animations

#### Task 1: CSS Transitions
- **Duration:** 1.5 hours
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Introduction to CSS Transitions:
    - Allows elements to change property values smoothly rather than instantly.
  - **Transition Properties:**
    1. `transition-property`: Specifies the CSS property to animate (e.g., `all`, `background-color`, `width`, `transform`).
    2. `transition-duration`: Defines how long the transition takes (e.g., `1s`, `500ms`).
    3. `transition-timing-function`: Controls the speed curve of the transition (e.g., `linear`, `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, `cubic-bezier`).
    4. `transition-delay`: Sets a delay before the transition starts (e.g., `0s`, `1s`).
- **Hands-on Practice:**
  - Created a webpage demonstrating smooth transitions for hover effects.
  - Practiced using `transition-property`, `transition-duration`, and `transition-timing-function`.

#### Task 2: CSS Transforms
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Introduction to CSS Transforms:
    - Allows visual manipulation of elements (e.g., move, rotate, scale, skew).
  - **Transform Types:**
    1. `translateX(px)` / `translateY(px)` / `translate(x, y)`: Moves the element left/right or up/down.
    2. `scale(n)` / `scaleX(n)` / `scaleY(n)`: Enlarges or shrinks the element.
    3. `rotate(deg)`: Rotates the element clockwise or counterclockwise.
    4. `skewX(deg)` / `skewY(deg)`: Skews the element along the X or Y axis.
    5. `matrix(a, b, c, d, e, f)`: Applies all transformations in one function (advanced use).
- **Hands-on Practice:**
  - Created a webpage demonstrating transformations like `translate`, `scale`, `rotate`, and `skew`.
  - Practiced combining multiple transformations.

#### Task 3: CSS Animations
- **Duration:** 2 hours
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Introduction to CSS Animations:
    - Allows elements to shift from one state to another.
  - **Animation Properties:**
    1. `animation-name`: Specifies the name of the `@keyframes` animation to apply.
    2. `animation-duration`: Defines how long the animation takes (e.g., `2s`, `500ms`).
    3. `animation-delay`: Sets a delay before the animation starts (e.g., `1s`, `0ms`).
    4. `animation-iteration-count`: Controls how many times the animation repeats (e.g., `1`, `3`, `infinite`).
    5. `animation-direction`: Specifies the direction of the animation on each cycle (e.g., `normal`, `reverse`, `alternate`).
    6. `animation-timing-function`: Determines the pace of the animation (e.g., `ease`, `linear`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`).
    7. `animation-fill-mode`: Defines how styles are applied before and after the animation (e.g., `none`, `forwards`, `backwards`, `both`).
  - **Keyframes:**
    - `@keyframes` defines the animation states:
      - `from {}`: Starting state.
      - `to {}`: Ending state.
- **Hands-on Practice:**
  - Created animations using `@keyframes` and applied them to elements.
  - Practiced using `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, and `animation-iteration-count`.
