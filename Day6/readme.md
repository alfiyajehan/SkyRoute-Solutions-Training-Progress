### ðŸš€ Mission 7: JavaScript Basics

#### Task 1: Variables and Constants
- **Duration:** 30 minutes
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Variables:
    - Name of a memory location.
    - Declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`.
    - Difference between `var` and `let`:
      - `var`: Global scope, re-declaration allowed.
      - `let`: Block scope, no re-declaration.
  - Constants:
    - Declared using `const`.
    - Value cannot be changed once assigned.
  - Rules for Naming Variables:
    - Cannot use reserved keywords.
    - Must be meaningful.
    - Cannot start with a number.
    - Cannot contain spaces or hyphens.
    - Use camelCase.

#### Task 2: Data Types
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Primitive Types:
    - Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null.
  - Reference Types:
    - Objects:
      - Key-value pairs.
      - Accessed using dot notation or bracket notation.
    - Arrays:
      - Data structure for storing lists.
    - Functions:
      - Block of code that performs a specific task.

####  Operators
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Arithmetic Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`.
  - Assignment Operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.
  - Comparison Operators: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `===`, `!==`.
  - Logical Operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`.
  - Ternary Operators: `condition ? value1 : value2`.
  - Operator Precedence:
    - Order of operations: Brackets, Exponent, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction.

#### Control Statements
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Topics Covered:**
  - `if-else` Statements:
    - Conditional execution of code blocks.
  - `switch` Statements:
    - Multi-way branching based on expressions.

#### Task 5: Loops
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Topics Covered:**
  - `for` Loop:
    - Iterates a block of code a specific number of times.
  - `while` Loop:
    - Executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.
  - `do-while` Loop:
    - Executes a block of code at least once before checking the condition.
  - `for-in` Loop:
    - Iterates over the properties of an object.
  - `for-of` Loop:
    - Iterates over iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, and sets.

#### Task 6: Objects and Functions
- **Duration:** 2 hours
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Objects:
    - Collection of key-value pairs.
    - Dynamic nature: Properties and methods can be added or removed at runtime.
  - Functions:
    - Block of code that performs a specific task.
    - Factory Functions:
      - Create and return objects.
    - Constructor Functions:
      - Use `this` keyword to define properties and methods.
      - Create objects using `new` keyword.
  - Cloning Objects:
    - Methods: Iteration, `Object.assign()`, Spread Operator.

#### Task 7: Garbage Collection
- **Duration:** 15 minutes
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Garbage Collector:
    - Automatically deallocates memory for unused variables and constants.
